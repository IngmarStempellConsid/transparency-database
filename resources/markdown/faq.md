<x-ecl.accordion label="What is the DSA Transparency Database? ">
Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services
Act), or the ‘DSA’, is a comprehensive set of new rules regulating the responsibilities of digital services that act as
intermediaries within the EU to connect consumers with goods, services and content. These intermediary services include
online platforms, such as online marketplaces or social media networks.<br/><br/>

The DSA Transparency Database collects the statement of reasons submitted by providers of online platforms to the
Commission, in line with Article 24(5) DSA. The database is publicly accessible and machine-readable.

<x-ecl.accordion label="What is a statement of reasons? ">
Article 17 DSA requires providers of hosting services to provide affected recipients of the service with clear and
specific reasons for restrictions on content that is allegedly illegal or incompatible with the provider’s terms and
conditions. In other words, providers of hosting services need to inform their users of the content moderation decisions
they take and explain the reasons behind those decisions. A statement of reasons is an important tool to empower users
to understand and potentially challenge content moderation decisions taken by providers of hosting services.<br/><br/>

Hosting services are a broad range of online intermediaries, including cloud and webhosting services, but this database
only collects statements of reasons from online platforms, which is a subset of hosting services.

<x-ecl.accordion label="Why was the DSA Transparency Database created? ">
The DSA Transparency Database was created in line with Article 24(5) DSA, to ensure transparency and scrutiny of content
moderation decisions of the providers of online platforms, and to monitor the spread of illegal and harmful content
online.

<x-ecl.accordion label="Who can use the DSA Transparency Database? ">
The DSA Transparency Database is publicly accessible. Visitors of the site can search, read and download statements of
reasons. You can find the link to the “Search for statements of reasons” page <a href="{{route('statement.index')}}">here</a>.

<x-ecl.accordion label="I would like to extract a large number of statements of reasons. How do I do that? ">
Currently, the data extraction feature supports downloading the first 1000 records of a given search result in .csv
format. A user can extract data multiple times in regular intervals.

would like to make suggestions, please use the feedback form.
