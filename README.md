DSA Transparency Database [![Laravel](https://github.com/digital-services-act/transparency-database/actions/workflows/vapor.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/digital-services-act/transparency-database/actions/workflows/vapor.yml)
=========================

The DSA Transparency database collects and analyzes statements of reasons, helping Internet users to know their rights and understand the law. These data enable us to study the prevalence of legal threats and let Internet users see the source of content removals.

Automated Submissions and Search Using the API
==============================================
The main [Transparency Database](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/) has an API that allows individuals and organizations that receive large numbers of notices to submit them without using the web interface. The API also provides an easy way for researchers to search the database. Members of the public can test the database, but will likely need to request an API key from the DSA team to receive a token that provides full access. To learn about the capabilities of the API, you can consult the [API documentation](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/page/api-documentation).
